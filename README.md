# Advanced Git Workshop

This repo is used in the Advanced Git workshop to walk thru various git commands such as log, checkout, revert, and reset.

## Description

Throughout your Bloomtech experience thus far you have learned how to work with Git and have had practice using the basic commands for staging, commiting, pushing, and publishing your commits to a fork. Learning now, the rest of what you need in order to work as a productive member of a product organization will set you up for success not only in labs, but give you insight into what how the product teams work in the real world.

## Branches

For this workshop you will find branches setup for each command. These branches will have additional files with instructions. You will find the following branches:

- `checkout`

- `reset`

You can checkout a branch and follow along the MD file named after the command, eg. `checkout.md` will have instructions for the checkout command.
