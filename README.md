# Advanced Git Workshop

This repo is used in the Advanced Git workshop to walk through various git commands, such as log, checkout, revert, and reset.

## Description

Throughout your Bloomtech experience so far, you have learned how to work with git and have had practice using the basic commands for staging, commiting, pushing, and publishing your commits to a fork. Exploring the rest of what you'll need in order to work as a productive member of a product organization will set you up for successâ€”not only in Labs, but by giving you insight into how product teams work in the real world.

## Branches

For this workshop, you'll find branches set up for each command. These branches will have additional files with instructions. You will find the following branches:

- [checkout](https://github.com/BloomTech-Labs/adv_git_workshop/tree/checkout/checkout.md)
  - `git checkout checkout`
- [revert](https://github.com/BloomTech-Labs/adv_git_workshop/blob/revert/revert.md)
  - `git checkout revert`
- [reset](https://github.com/BloomTech-Labs/adv_git_workshop/blob/reset/reset.md)
  - `git checkout reset`

You can `checkout` a branch and follow along in the markdown file named after the command. For example, `checkout.md` will have instructions for the `checkout` command.
